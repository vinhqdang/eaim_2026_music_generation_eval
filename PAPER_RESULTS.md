**Behavioral Evaluation of Co-Creative Music Models (No-Human Variant)**

Date: October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

We evaluated 4 music generation models across 3 behavioral tasks using 13 automated metrics, generating **1,800 audio samples** and **1,800 MIDI samples** (100 prompts/seeds × 2 models × 3 random seeds × 3 tasks per domain).

### Key Findings

1. **Audio Domain**: Stable Audio Open achieves better audio quality (FAD), MusicGen-Large shows superior text-adherence (CLAP Score)
2. **Symbolic Domain**: REMI Transformer excels at rhythm and beat modeling, Music Transformer produces more structurally coherent outputs
3. **Task Difficulty**: All models perform best on T2 (Style Adherence), struggle with T3 (Edit-Responsiveness)
4. **Statistical Significance**: Friedman tests confirm significant differences across models for all primary metrics (p < 0.0001)

## 6. Limitations and Caveats

### 6.1 Methodological Limitations

1. **No Human Evaluation**: All metrics are automated; human perception may differ
2. **Reference Bias**: FAD depends on reference set selection
3. **Metric Limitations**:
   - Structure F1 assumes perfect boundary detection
   - CLAP may not capture all aspects of text-audio alignment
   - Perplexity measures plausibility, not creativity

### 6.2 Dataset Limitations

1. **Training Data Unknown**: Cannot verify if test prompts/seeds appeared in training
2. **Genre Bias**: Models trained on different genre distributions
3. **Length Constraints**: Stable Audio limited to 47s (vs. 60s for MusicGen)

### 6.3 Reproducibility Notes

1. **Seed Variance**: Structure metrics show high variance (CV > 24%)
2. **Temperature Sensitivity**: Results based on default sampling parameters
3. **Compute Requirements**: Full replication requires ~60 GPU-hours
